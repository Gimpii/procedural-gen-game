Work for a major project 2022

GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS

When starting up the project, you will be met with a large purple box, some buttons, sliders and input fields. This is the map generation options for you to tweak, in which you will play the game on the map you create.

MAP CONFIGURATIONS:
Top left Button: Refresh button to generate a map based on current settings
Seed Input: A value that the computer uses to generate the map (Leave empty if unsure)
Map Size: The number of tiles along the x and y axis to be generated
Wall Density: A multiplier for how much wall clusters there are
Wall Size: A multiplier for the size of the wall clusters

To begin the game, press the begin button

CONTROLS:
WASD - move the character about
ARROW KEY PADS - Shoot a projectile in the direction of the keypad
SPACE BAR - Gives the player a small 'Dash' which will jolt the player in the direction they're moving

ENEMY INFORMATION
The pink squares are the enemy. They will follow you around and shoot little green projectiles at you. Your goal is to avoid these projectiles and shoot back at the enemies to eliminate them. If you are hit with an enemy projectile, your character will cease any function and disappear, and you will spawn back at the centre of the map upon pressing the respawn button. There are only 4 enemies on the map at any given time.
